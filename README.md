# Huffman_Tree_GUI
A Java Project for displaying the Huffman Encoding Tree and decoding a bit string using the same

# Libraries and Algorithms used:
1) JavaFX for visualization
2) Built-in PriorityQueue for implementing Min Heap (required to build encoding tree)

# Usage
Firstly, install javaFX libraries in the system.
Then,
1) javac HuffmanTree.java
2) javac DisplaySimpleTree.java
3) java DisplaySimpleTree
Now you can see the GUI

# What is Huffman Coding
A Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding and/or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding algorithm which derives the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.
