# Huffman_Tree_GUI
A Java Project for displaying the Huffman Encoding Tree and decoding a bit string using the same

# What is Huffman Coding
A Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding and/or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding algorithm which derives the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value of the source symbol.

# Libraries and Algorithms used:
1. JavaFX for visualization
2. Built-in PriorityQueue for implementing Min Heap (required to build encoding tree)

# Usage
Firstly, install javaFX libraries in the system.
Then run the following commands,
1. `javac HuffmanTree.java`
2. `javac DisplaySimpleTree.java`
3. `java DisplaySimpleTree`
Now you should be able to see the GUI.
